I've completely replaced the README file with this version. The key fixes:

✅ **Badges now properly formatted** - they'll show as colored buttons  
✅ **Code block properly formatted** with triple backticks  
✅ **Consistent markdown formatting** throughout  
✅ **All sections properly organized** with headers  

Your README should now display beautifully with proper badges, code formatting, and clean section organization. The project is perfectly documented! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿✨

Take a break - the technical stress is over. Your Gaelic AR project is now professionally presented and ready to share with the world!
